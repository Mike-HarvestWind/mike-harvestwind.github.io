        <p>Friends,</p>
            <p>I started Harvest Wind to invest in and operate principled small businesses that make a positive impact on ther stakeholders -- in big ways or small.  We prioritize long-term business-building over short-term financial returns, operational collaboration, humility, a sense of humor, and
                authenticity.</p>

            <p>We are a holding company which intentionally affords us the flexibility to invest for the long-term without the need to ever sell unlike traditional private equity funds, while our dedication to deploying capital
                efficiently and patiently allows us to target services or markets traditionally unfit / misfit for typical investors.</p>
            
            <p>We focus on identifying underserved but highly sustainable niches. We invest to operate alongside our partners, valuing hands-on collaboration with
                founders and management teams. We focus on true partnership via aligned incentives and transparency. We thrive on doing hard things with great people.  And we always stop to enjoy the ride.</p>
            
            <p>Perhaps above all, we aim to approach the world without ego and aim to always be earnest, curious, humble, and authentic in whatever we do.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Hope to talk soon,</p>
            <p>Mike DeMatteis</p>
            <p>Founder & CEO</p>
