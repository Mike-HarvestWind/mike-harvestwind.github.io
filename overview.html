        <p>Friends,</p>
            <p>I started Harvest Wind to invest in and operate high quality small businesses in industries that steward the environment (both the organic and built worlds) and/or its various stakeholders.  We prioritize long-term business-building over short-term financial returns, humility, a sense of humor, thematic focus, and
                operational collaboration.</p>

            <p>We are a holding company which intentionally affords us the flexibility to invest for the long-term (thinking in
                decades rather than quarters) unlike traditional private equity funds, while our dedication to deploying capital
                efficiently and patiently allows us to target services or markets traditionally unfit / misfit for venture capitalists.</p>
            
            <p>We focus on identifying underserved but highly sustainable niches. We invest to operate alongside our partners, prioritizing hands-on collaboration with
                founders and management teams. We value true partnership via aligned incentives and transparency. We thrive on doing hard things with great people.  And we always stop to enjoy the ride.</p>
            
            <p>Above all else, we aim to approach the world without ego and aim to always be earnest, curious, compassionate, and humble in whatever we do.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Hope to talk soon,</p>
            <p>Mike DeMatteis</p>
            <p>Founder & CEO</p>
