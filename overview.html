        <p>Friends,</p>
            <p>I started Harvest Wind to invest in and operate high quality small businesses in industries that steward the environment (both the organic and built worlds) or human health.  We prioritize long-term business-building over short-term financial returns, humility, a sense of humor, thematic focus, and
                operational collaboration.</p>

            <p>We are a holding company which intentionally affords us the flexibility to invest for the long-term (thinking in
                decades rather than quarters) unlike traditional private equity funds, while our dedication to deploying capital
                efficiently and patiently allows us to target services or markets traditionally unfit / misfit for venture capitalists.</p>
            
            <p>We focus on identifying underserved but highly sustainable niches through deep
                industry research. We invest to operate alongside our partners, prioritizing hands-on collaboration with
                founders and management teams (after all, the hard work of building is the most fun).</p>
            
            <p>Above all, we aim to approach the world of investing and operating without ego and aim to always be earnest, curious, and humble in whatever we do.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Talk soon,</p>
            <p>Mike DeMatteis</p>
            <p>Founder & CEO</p>
