        <p> Dear friends,</p>
            <p>I started Harvest Wind to invest in small and mid-sized businesses that make the world a better place through agriculture, food, or the
            environment.  We prioritize long-term business-building over short-term financial returns, humility, a sense of humor, thematic focus, and
            operational collaboration.</p>

            <p>Our holding company structure affords us the flexibility to invest for the long-term (thinking in
            decades rather than quarters) unlike traditional private equity funds while our dedication to deploying capital
            efficiently and patiently allows us to target services or markets traditionally unfit for venture capitalists.</p>
            
            <p>We focus on identifying underserved but highly sustainable niches through deep
            industry research. We invest to operate alongside our partners, prioritizing hands-on collaboration with
            founders and management teams (after all, the hard work of building is the most fun). </p>
            
            <p>Above all, we aim to approach the world of investing with an egoless attitude and aim to always be earnest, curious, and humble in whatever we do.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p>Mike DeMatteis</p>
        <p>Founder & CEO</p>
