        <p> Dear friends,</p>
            <p>I started Harvest Wind to invest in small and mid-sized businesses serving fragmented and/or complex value chains across agriculture, food, and the
            environment. We prioritize long-term partnership over short-term investing, humility, thematic focus, and
            operational collaboration.</p>

            <p>Our structure affords us the flexibility to invest for the long-term (thinking in
            decades rather than years) unlike traditional private equity firms, while our dedication to deploying capital
            efficiently and patiently allows us to target solutions or markets traditionally unfit for venture capital.</p>
            
            <p>We focus on identifying underserved niches within the agrifood and environmental services space via deep
            industry research. We invest to operate alongside our partners, prioritizing hands-on collaboration with
            founders and management teams (after all, the hard work of building is the most fun).</p>
            
            <p>Above all, we aim to approach the world of investing and operating with an egoless attitude and aim to always be earnest, curious, and humble in whatever we do.</p>
        <p>Talk soon,</p>
        <p>Mike DeMatteis</p>
